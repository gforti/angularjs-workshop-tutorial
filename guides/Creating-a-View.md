#Creating a View

So the idea here is we want to create a page that will render a list of all the phones.  Before we do that we just want to focus on getting the routing to work with a home page.

Start by adding the following code into the app.js file.

We now need to add a phone-list.template.html file and a phone-list.controller.js file under the js folder like so.
