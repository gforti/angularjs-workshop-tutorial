Create a new JavaScript file called __app.js__ under the folder __js__

Write the following code into the file _app.js_ file. The function wrapper will serve as a way for us to not create global variables within our JavaScript code.  We will do this in all of our JavaScript angular files.  Lets create the app module and add in the ngRoute module to use later on.

Lets add this file to the index.html page and also include the ng-app atrribute reference to the body tag. When this is complete make sure to run the index.html page in your browser to ensure there are no JavaScript errors.
